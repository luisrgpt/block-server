    Try to do this by yourself before reading the answer:
 
    - In the ECB mode, any change to a ciphertext block will completely randomize the corresponding plaintext block on decryption. This means that you can't determine how to change your grade deterministically.
+     However, since each block is independent from the others, you can instead copy a whole block over the block you want to change. Since you know what the corresponding plaintext it, you are effectively changing the grade.
    - In the CBC mode, a change to a ciphertext block will randomize its plaintext, but will affect trivially the corresponding bits on the next block. 
      This means that you can change your grade deterministically, although it will also have the side-effect of garbling the previous block.
    - In the OFB mode, since the plaintext is XOR'd with the already encrypted keystream, any bit flip in the ciphertext will affect trivially the corresponding bit on the plaintext, with no side-effects.
